### Piping/grouping/summarizing

# Matt Note: pipe takes the left side and sends it to the right side. Like an oil refinery,
# take the raw on the left and send it to processing on the right
# This is a workflow thing, basically helps you keep things clean over multiple lines. Multiple operations at once

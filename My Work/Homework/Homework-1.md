Question 1
----------

With our Austin flight data, I wanted to look at cancellations not just
by the day of the week, but also by the listed cause of delay.

There are some clear trends that can be seen in these bar graphs.
Carrier cancellations are most common during the week and less common on
weekend flights. NAS cancellations are more common on Monday and
Tuesday, with the rest of the days being fairly similar. Lastly, weather
delays are more common on weekends, but Tuesday seems to be an outlier.

Question 2
----------

The following is from the code Dr.Â Scott provided that extracts the 350
and 65 AMG trim levels as subsets of the data.
